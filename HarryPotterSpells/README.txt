HARRY POTTER SPELLS: Version 1.0

REQUIREMENTS: Blade and Sorcery Version U10.2

FEATURES:

UPDATES:
Currently the sound cuts out during spells that despawn. I am working on this still. Will update the mod once its finished.
Also working on speech recognition for spells, hopefully I will be able to get that 

But honestly, have fun! I put alot of time and effort into this mod.
There are no external mod requirements for this mod.
